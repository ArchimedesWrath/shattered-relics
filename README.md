## Starting Out
If you haven't already read the [leagues III wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Shatte#ff6347_Relics_League) to familiarize yourself with the league mechanic. All players start with defense, theiving, and fishing skills unlocked. Players then get to choose 1 combat skill to unlock right at the start.

### Euphoria

* [ ] <span style="color:#3cb371">Open the leagues menu</span>
* [ ] Unlock your first combat skill, I reccomend mage or range as it will be broken in the early game for safe spotting.

| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Me from the future here. I've crunched the numbers and I'm pretty sure it's always a magic start. Early magic levels gives you better dps against bosses compared to range and gives you jewlery enchantment. I'm going to be starting range for my incredibly sweaty gauntlet rush, but I assume magic is going to be a bit better. There are also a lot of early quests that give magic xp.|
